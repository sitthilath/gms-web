                            Through its effects on temperature and precipitation patterns, climate change is widely expected to impact crop
                            yields and food supplies. Negative impacts on food security and the nutritional status of low-income and
                            vulnerable individuals are likely to be especially acute. This presentation highlights some of the conceptual
                            and empirical links between climate and nutrition insecurity, presents empirical evidence regarding these
                            connections, and outlines several action items for further research and policy attention

                            Large-scale food fortification (LSFF), is a critical intervention that addresses global micronutrient
                            deficiencies through the strategic fortification of commonly consumed foods such as rice, flour, salt
                            or edible oil with vitamins and minerals. It is a key public health strategy with the dual potential to
                            significantly improve nutritional status and drive economic progress by improving health outcomes
                            and labour productivity. Despite the obvious benefits, the implementation of food fortification on a
                            mass scale faces several technical, logistical, cultural and regulatory challenges. These challenges
                            require quality control, effective supply chain management, cultural and consumer acceptance, and
                            the establishment of robust policy and regulatory frameworks. Examples for both successful
                            implementations and the obstacles faced, will be presented providing a balanced perspective on the
                            practicalities of food fortification at scale. The discourse extends to the critical role of cross-sector
                            partnerships, technological innovation in fortification processes, and the indispensable need for
                            comprehensive public education to ensure consumer acceptance. Finally, the presentation advocates
                            for a unified approach among governments, industry players, NGOs and communities to navigate the
                            complexities of food fortification and underscores its potential as a game-changer in the global fight
                            against malnutrition. The future of food fortification is considered in the context of emerging trends
                            and potential advances, calling for concerted efforts to realise its full public health potential.

                            being experienced in Lao PDR. the Government of the Lao PDR has also taken steps to make the
                            country more resilient to the impacts of climate change, especially in vulnerable sectors such as public
                            health, agriculture, forestry and land use, water resources, transport, and energy (1,2). For public
                            health, the country developed its Strategy on Climate Change and Health Adaptation 2018–2025 and
                            Action Plan 2018–2020, defining the strategic direction for building a climate-resilient health system.
                            A priority area of the strategy is to build climate-resilient water sanitation hygiene and health care
                            waste management services and health care facilities in flood-prone areas (2,4).

                            though a large majority of facilities have reportedly been impacted by extreme weather events in the
                            last 20 years. Over half of HCFs that experienced extreme weather events attributable to climate
                            change have been severely damaged in the last two decades, yet only 1% of HCFs have any measures

                            While every Member State in the world has made enormous efforts in advancing the SDGs since
                            2015, the 2023 Sustainable Development Goals Report revealed alarming results (1). At the midpoint
                            to the deadline of the 2030 agenda, half of 140 targets which have data available for the evaluation
                            are off track, and 30% of these targets, specifically targets on poverty, hunger and climate, show no
                            progress or regression. The report also underscored inequities, how the COVID-19 pandemic, the
                            triple planetary crisis and the complex geopolitical situation have had disproportionate impacts across
                            the globe and within a country. The result is aligned with the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress
                            Report 2024 (2). The Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2024 also alerted the Region with
                            extremely slow progress across all 17 SDGs in the Asia and Pacific Region and urges immediate
                            action for climate change which showed regression below the 2015 baseline. Its sub-analysis for
                            South-East Asia suggests that moderate progress on the SDG 3 Good health and well-being; low
                            progress in the SDG 2 Zero hunger; regression in the SDG 13 Climate action and the SDG 12
                            Responsible consumption and production; and little progress in other SDGs related to climate change.

                            In this context, the United Nations proposed six key transitions to accelerate the progress (3): food
                            systems; energy access and affordability; digital connectivity; education; jobs and social protection;
                            and climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The SDGs are intertwined, which requires an
                            integrated approach to accelerate the progress across the 17 SDGs. All the key transitions are also
                            interconnected in accelerating the progress of multiple SDGs. The significant impact of climate
                            change on health and nutrition now urges our collective actions to address these challenges in more
                            strategic, innovative and integrated ways (4,5). In the health sector, there are various efforts to build
                            the resilient and sustainable health system to achieve the universal health coverage and other health-
                            related SDGs. Here, a couple of selected innovative approaches in the health sector in Lao PDR will
                            be introduced, using one of the key six transitions, digital transformation.

                            In alignment with priorities of the Health Sector Reform Strategy 2021-2030 (6) and the 9th Health
                            Sector Development Plan (7), the Ministry of Health (MOH), Lao PDR has made great efforts to
                            enhance data-informed planning for strategic resource allocation with strong emphasis on vulnerable
                            populations, using the geographic information system. The MOH has mapped all the socio-
                            demographic data of the catchment areas, road access, geographical locations of health facilities,
                            human resources for health, and utilization of healthcare services using the District Health
                            Information Software version 2 into the map of Lao PDR to support the subnational planning for
                            strengthening primary health care. Furthermore, since malnutrition has been identified as a significant
                            public health and development issue in Lao PDR, MOH (8), with support from various development
                            partners, has invested in improving nutrition surveillance system to better understand nutritional
                            trends, identify at-risk populations, and tailor interventions accordingly.

                            As part of innovative approaches which the MOH introduced in the health sector, the MOH has also
                            initiated the integration of climate data, such as temperature and rainfall data received from weather
                            stations around the country, into the national Health Management Information System to forecast
                            climate-sensitive diseases using statistical models through an early warning, alert, and response/
                            system (9). Early warning systems can predict and alert authorities of potential health and nutrition
                            risks, such as waterborne diseases, vector-borne diseases, and malnutrition. It also contributes to
                            building the national health system’s and the society’s resilience for future climate-related challenges.

                            The SDG progress reports at the global and regional levels (1,2) call for urgent actions by the

                            of the SDGs collectively. Regression in achieving the SDG 13, specifically, draws a strong attention

                            (10). To address the challenges effectively, we will need to enhance close coordination across
                            relevant sectors beyond health; incorporate innovate tools and solutions; strengthen the health system
                            and the entire society to be more sustainable and resilient in the future; and empower and work with

                            Climate change appears to be not only an environmental health problem, but also a nutritional and
                            health issue. Many studies have been conducted to determine the effect of climate change on
                            environmental health, but research on the impact of climate change on nutrition and health is still
                            rare. Therefore, it is important to describe the impact of climate change on weather disasters, food
                            systems, biodiversity loss, nutrient loss, and health.

                            Climate change has resulted in weather disasters because of heatwaves, wildfires, drought, floods,
                            and storms. After that, it affected soil fertility and rain patterns, so crop yields and food production
                            dropped. Then the stability of the global food system was attempted and mass food production
                            focused on conventional cereal and crops by using fertilizer and deforestation. As a result,
                            biodiversity and gene diversity of species and ecosystems are lost. Moreover, nutrient content
                            changed or lost, so human health was impacted. The impacts started from increasing insect
                            populations as vectors of disease because of increasing global temperature. Also, the air pollution that
                            comes from wildfire, human activity, and natural disasters could produce many more oxidants which
                            result in lower immune systems and emerging of noncommunicable diseases.

                            decreasing food production, then had an impact on biodiversity loss and nutrition loss. Finally, human
                            health has been attacked by infectious disease and degenerative diseases, so we should maximize one

                            This talk explores equity considerations within public health initiatives in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, an
                            area characterised by both rapid economic and public health development and persistent health disparities.
                            Challenges include global and regional politics, geographic and cultural diversity, socioeconomic differences,
                            climate/environmental change, and resource and infrastructural limitations. Comparative analysis of existing
                            policies and interventions can identify areas for potential improvement based on principles of social justice,
                            community engagement, and intersectoral collaboration. Highlighting examples and best practices within and
                            beyond the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, we can identify lessons and recommendations for policymakers,
                            practitioners, and other stakeholders on strengthening equity within public health policies and initiatives in the
                            region. The talk advocates for public health equity through considering structural and social health
                            determinants, encouraging public sector engagement with diverse communities, and ensuring equitable health
                            services access in the pursuit of health and wellbeing in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region.
